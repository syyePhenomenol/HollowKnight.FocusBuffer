# Focus Buffer
Hollow Knight mod that allows you to buffer input for Focus.

Default behaviour is that you need to press the Focus button while you aren't taking damage in order to heal.

With this mod, you can heal even if you started holding down the Focus button while taking damage.

Requires [Vasi](https://github.com/fifty-six/HollowKnight.Vasi/tree/master/Vasi).
